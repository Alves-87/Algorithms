Algorithms Project 2 README

Program must be:
Compiled: g++ -std=c++11 convexhull.cpp -o project2
Ran: ./project2 [algType] datafile_name

All test data samples were generated by using ConvexHull_GUI.java file:

Graham Scan was adapted from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-2-graham-scan/
Jarvis March was adapted from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-1-jarviss-algorithm-or-wrapping/
Quick Hull was adapted from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quickhull-algorithm-convex-hull/

- The preliminary functions used for this program included swap, orientation, nextToTop, compare, findSide, dist, lineDist
- The Graham Scan
        First we sort the points in the array. IF two point have the same y value, the point with the smaller x-coordinate will be considered. We then
        allow points based on the orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise, right or left turn, respecitvely). If it is not counterclockwise, it is discarded.
- Jarvis March
    Start from the leftmost point (or point with minimum x coordinate value) and we keep wrapping points in counterclockwise direction. Use orientation() to in finding the next point.
    the next point is selected best point based on its orientation. This continues till the last point is reached.
- Quick Hull
	-Find the point with minimum x-coordinate lets say, min_x and similarly the point with maximum x-coordinate, max_x.
	
	-Make a line joining these two points, say L. This line will divide the the whole set into two parts. 
         Take both the parts one by one and proceed further.

	-For a part, find the point P with maximum distance from the line L. P forms a triangle with the points min_x, max_x. 
	 It is clear that the points residing inside this triangle can never be the part of convex hull.
	
	-The above step divides the problem into two sub-problems (solved recursively). Now the line joining the points P and min_x and the line joining the points P 
	 and max_x are new lines and the points residing outside the triangle is the set of points. Repeat point no. 3 till there no point left with the line.
