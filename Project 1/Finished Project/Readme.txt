Part I: RSA key generation.

Implemented RSA encrotion using methods disscused in class
-Implement Fermat test;
-Use Fermatâ€™s test to generate two large prime numbers (p,q), each of atleast 155 digits
-Use extended Euclidean algorithm to generate two pairs of keys: (e,n), (d,n), where 
n=p*q;
phi =(p-1)(q-1)
-Saved the two pairs of keys in two separate files: e_n.txt and d_n.txt and Saved p and q in a file named p_q.txt

Part II: Generate and verify digital signatures using a SHA-256 hash.
- File to implement the digital signature and verify it
- The main function will hash the file each time whether signing or verifying is being done.
